Object:
An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. The car class has common properties of wheels, speed limits, mileage. Now a car can have different numbers of wheels eg.: 2,3,4 so on.
Similary it may have different speed limits(40KMPH, 50KMPH, 60KMPH etc.) and mileage(25KMPL, 26KMPL, 30KMPL etc.), these can be termed as objects.
