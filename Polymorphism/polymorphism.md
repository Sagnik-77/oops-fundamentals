Polymorphism:
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.

A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

An operation may exhibit different behaviours in different instances. The behaviour depends upon the types of data used in the operation.

Example: Suppose we have to write a function to add some integers, some times there are 2 integers, some times there are 3 integers. We can write the Addition Method with the same name having different parameters, the concerned method will be called according to parameters.
